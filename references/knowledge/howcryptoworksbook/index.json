    "summary": "Before exploring the technical mechanics of blockchains or the intricacies of DeFi protocols, you must first understand the environment you are entering. Crypto is arguably the most aggressively capitalist, meritocratic, and adversarial environment ever created. At its core, it is a financial system with absolutely no safety net. To the average person, this environment is alien. In the traditional world, if you lose your credit card, you call the bank. If a transaction is fraudulent, you dispute it. If you forget your password, you reset it. There is always a higher authority to appeal to, a centralized custodian responsible for your safety.",

On January 3rd, 2009, its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, inscribed a telling message into Bitcoin's **genesis block**, the first block in its blockchain. The headline from *The Times* read: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" It served as a permanent statement of purpose, a critique embedded in code against centralized financial systems that had failed the world. Bitcoin's design draws from the cypherpunk movement, which championed using cryptography to protect individual freedom and financial sovereignty. Rather than relying on banks or governments, Bitcoin functions as a peer-to-peer electronic cash sy",

This shift unlocked possibilities that didn't exist before. Decentralized exchanges let people trade tokens without intermediaries.

Notably, these applications work together seamlessly. A lending protocol can automatically interact with an exchange, creating financial products that emerge organically from the platform itself.",

It prioritizes raw speed and throughput over keeping hardware requirements low, betting that powerful computers will become cheaper faster than blockchain demand will grow. Most blockchains execute transactions one at a time within blocks. When you send a transaction on Ethereum, it waits in line behind every other transaction, processed sequentially to avoid conflicts.

A 12-word mnemonic can hold millions of dollars with no physical footprint.
